6. Secure WebApps

   WebApps are more accessible than Desktop applications. You do not need to install anything in your computer or mobile device. You only need a browser and internet connection.
   Some of the WebApps require access to sensible data in the mobile device (location, microphone, camera). This requires secure (https) access to the WebApps. See the tutorial referred bellow to learn how to implement secure WebApps.
